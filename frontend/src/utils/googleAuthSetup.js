=======================================================
🔐 Google OAuth Configuration Guide for ${currentOrigin}
=======================================================

Your application is trying to use Google Sign-In from ${currentOrigin}, 
but this origin is not authorized in your Google Cloud Console.

Follow these steps to fix the issue:

1️⃣ Go to Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

2️⃣ Select your project (Client ID: ${clientId})

3️⃣ Find and click on your OAuth 2.0 Client ID used for web application

4️⃣ Under "Authorized JavaScript origins", click ADD URI

5️⃣ Add this exact origin: ${currentOrigin}

6️⃣ Click SAVE at the bottom of the page

7️⃣ Wait a few minutes for changes to propagate

8️⃣ Refresh your application and try Google Sign-In again

Note: If you're developing locally and frequently changing ports,
you might want to add multiple localhost URLs with different ports:
- ${currentOrigin}
- http://localhost:5173
- http://localhost:5001
- http://localhost:3000
- http://localhost:5175
